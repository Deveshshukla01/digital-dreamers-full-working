                        <h1>Top 5 Criteria for Every SEO Audit</h1><br>
                        <p>In this rapidly changing world of Digital Marketing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) remains an essential aspect for every business. SEO aims at increasing the online presence of the businesses. Whether a digital marketing agency or an SEO agency is usually responsible to perform SEO related services of the company. Analyzing this SEO aspect and perform an audit out of it is known as SEO Audits. This report acts as a guiding tool when it comes to understand search engine rankings, organic traffic, paid traffic and even conversion rates. In this article we'll understand the top 5 criteria for every successful SEO Audit-</p>
                        <h3>Technical SEO</h3><br>
                        <p>Technical SEO is all about website's visibility. The most important aspect during an audit is to analyse factors like website speed, mobile friendliness, errors and omissions, indexation issues etc. Solving these technical aspects makes the search engines more crawl able and place the site more efficiently, leading it to better rankings.</p>
                        <h3>On-Page SEO</h3><br>
                        <p>This aspect focuses mainly on optimization, whether it is an individual web page or improving the relevance of keywords. In On-Page SEO elements like meta tags (title and description), headings (H1, H2, etc.), keyword research and usage, content quality, back-links, and Alt Image optimization. Thus maintaining a proper on page health and ensuring content quality makes it easier for a business to get a higher rank</p>
                        <h3>Content Quality</h3><br>
                        <p> As we all know content is the most important asset of every business. Even in SEO too, all the rankings depends on the content quality only. Thus SEO Audit helps us to evaluate the quality, relevance, quantity and uniqueness of a website content. Elements like readability, engagement 
                            metrics, and duplicate content remains a powerful tool to analyse whether the content is worth publishing or not.</p>
                        <h3>Back-links</h3><br>
                        <p>Back-links are the backbone of every business. Back-links acts as a trust maker in the eyes of the customers. Therefore in SEO Audits, evaluating the number of back-links, the quantity, quality, and relevance of the links acts a deciding force whether the company is going to be rank well or not. Hence back-links needs to be made on regular basis by the business either with the help of a digital marketing agency or by their own. An SEO Audit may also identify toxic back-links that could harm rankings and create a hurdle for building trustworthiness and credibility among customers</p>
                        <h3>User Experience (UX)</h3><br>
                        <p> User experience is one of the most underrated element of an SEO Audit. It simply means to ensure that the website delivers a satisfying performance to the customers. Factors such as site navigation, page load times, mobile responsiveness, and usability acts as a significant role in SEO rankings. Issues like bounce rates or low engagement are then eliminated by considering SEO Audit</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>In conclusion, Undoubtedly SEO is the most crucial aspect behind a company's growth and success. Rather than going for Paid Ads and spending millions and lakh into it, SEO still is a better option as it aims to drive organic traffic which is more likely to be converted into sales. An SEO audit serves as a tool to effectively evaluate aspects such as technical, on-page, content, back-link, and UX factors etc. Business can rely on these SEO Audits to understand the parameters where they are lacking. Therefore a well structured SEO Audit will enable businesses to solve the issues more efficiently and thus increase their website's search rankings and visibility</p>
